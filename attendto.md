# Things to Attend to
I don't mind being open about this

### Landing Page
- Navbar should become response, size-wise

### Creative Section

### Business Section

### Tech Section
- Hand-drawn shoutout section because I like draining the life out of me for the purpose of creativity (this is not completely sarcastic come to think of it)

#### Ideas
- A GIF of each part of me all interacting together
- Add some music for the site
- Settings section should involve toggling music, changing GIFs to stills, and the like...
