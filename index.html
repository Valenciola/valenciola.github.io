                <span><strong>Hi, I'm Valerie!</strong></span> I'm a full-time student at <strong>Florida Atlantic University</strong>, aiming to get a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. My main interest is software development, specifically <strong>web development, app development, and game development.</strong> I have experience in multiple languages, including <strong>C/C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python.</strong> I have a lot of experience with front-end operations, but I would like to learn more applications for back-end languages. My other interests include music composition, creative writing, and learning languages, all of which I can apply to game programming and also accessibility support via translation.

                <strong>Something new is coming for this website.</strong> It's a bit ambitious, but I've seen time and again that ideas don't need to stand in the way of reality. I'll be working behind the scenes, so come back one of these days to see if I really did make my idea real. On that day, this page will be a better reflection of me.
